# Filter Operation on a list 
A simple filter operation on a list in Python

## Program Structure
```
root/
|-- listOperations.py                     (* Main source file containing the program logic *)
|-- /test_listOperations.py                (* Test suite for the project *)

```

## The Program Logic
The program does the following:
1.Accepts a list of integers as input.
2.Raises an error message if the length of the input list is not a multiple of 10.
3.Returns or displays a list of integers derived from the input list. Items at positions that are multiples of both 2 and 3 are removed from the result.

## The Test Suite:
To test the written program icludes the following test cases
   1. Valid output on valid input
   2. If the list length is not a multiple of 10
   3. Empty list

## Test Results
After running the test file in the respectcive folder will get the following result:
